This is a basic prime number genarator written in C. And also there is a function to test if a number is prime or not given an input. Press any number greater than 1 and it will ask the user to put a range (n).
press 0 or anything less. It will ask the user for another number and it will chcek weather it is prime or not.
This is not a "well designed" program. I learned about "loops" 4 days ago.
